# Meteo station
This part of the project is dedicated to the development of the meteo station on raspberry pi. It is mainly coded in C++.
You need to buy some equipment for this part. You can use all the different models of Raspberry pi and some equivalent that have the same GPIO and that interpret C and C++ as Raspi. Originally the code is done for Arduino and hasn't the same connection function as this one. The code for arduino is available on an other repo called [A2_BLOC1_Project] (https://github.com/noiia/A2_BLOC1_Project){:target="_blank"}.
